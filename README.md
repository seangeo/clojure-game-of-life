# life

Conway's Game of Life in Clojure.

My first clojure program built at Rails Camp AU 12.

## Installation

Uses [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).

## Usage

    $ lien run

There are some pre-built starting patterns you can select in the life.clj
file but it all requires manual hacking atm.

## TODO

* Make the world Infinite!!
* Make the world Editable!!
* Profit!!
